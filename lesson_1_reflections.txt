How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the
bug that was introduced?

   The diff showed the location of lines that were added or removed.
   
 
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you 
a more efficient programmer in the long term?

    Not having to rename files for testing/versions.
    The ability to see changes in different versions.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to 
create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically 
saved, like Google Docs does?

    Committing when it makes sense for a longer term project.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving 
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat 
each file separately?

    Changes may be located across a number of files.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history 
of files?

    git log shows the history of commits. Git diff can be used to show 
    the difference between two commits.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes 
that could break something?

    It is easy to go back to an older working version.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using 
Git for?

    All the things.
