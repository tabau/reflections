What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    Git creates the repository (i.e. the .git folder) to keep track of files.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    Working directory is the files you directly work on. Staging area is
    where files are sent to build a commit. The repository is the
    commits that have been build using the staging area.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    By adding only the changed files you wish to commit to the staging area.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

    Creating new experimental features. Branches help by keeping the main
    (master) branch untouched whilst adding/changing code.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    By showing the path from the first commit to the last, across different
    branches.


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
