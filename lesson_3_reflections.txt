When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  To share with others, or to access from more than one computer.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Automatic updates may change files that you're working on and add commits
    you're not ready for.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

    A clone is a copy of another repository, whether on a file system, or
    another computer (e.g. GitHub). A fork is like a clone, but from one GitHub
    repository to another. A branch is a new line of development within a
    repository that can be pushed to other repositories.
