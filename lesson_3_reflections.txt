When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  To share with others, or to access from more than one computer.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Automatic updates may change files that you're working on and add commits
    you're not ready for.
