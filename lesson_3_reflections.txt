When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  To share with others, or to access from more than one computer.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Automatic updates may change files that you're working on and add commits
    you're not ready for.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

    A clone is a copy of another repository, whether on a file system, or
    another computer (e.g. GitHub). A fork is like a clone, but from one GitHub
    repository to another. A branch is a new line of development within a
    repository that can be pushed to other repositories.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can refer to the remote changes whilst offline, etc.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and
what would be harder?

    Sending changes via e-mail, etc or with renamed files, etc. Easier learning
    curve, but much harder to keep track of changes.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master? What benefits does each approach have?

    When working on different features, or collaborating to that each person
    doesn't cause issues on the master branch.
